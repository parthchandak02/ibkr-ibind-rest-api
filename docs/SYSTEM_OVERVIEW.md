# 🚀 IBKR Recurring Orders System - Complete Overview

## 🎯 **What We Built**

A **comprehensive automated trading system** that reads recurring order instructions from Google Sheets and executes them on Interactive Brokers with full logging and Discord notifications.

## 📊 **Your Google Sheets Control Panel**

Your sheet at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwyNMN_YRhU5IaYaG1OXaBGzgoYkBtF5rc9sO9Nyw48/edit

### **Current Structure:**
| Status | Stock Symbol | Amount (USD) | Frequency | Log |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Active | AAPL | 10 | Weekly | *Auto-populated* |
| Inactive | TSLA | 10 | Daily | *Auto-populated* |

### **How It Works:**
1. **Set Status to "Active"** → Order will be included in automation
2. **Choose Frequency:**
   - `Daily` → Executes every day at 9 AM EST
   - `Weekly` → Executes Mondays at 9 AM EST  
   - `Monthly` → Executes 1st of month at 9 AM EST
3. **System automatically logs results** to the Log column
4. **Discord notifications** sent for every execution

## 🔧 **System Components**

### **1. Core API (backend/api.py)**
- Main Flask application with all trading endpoints
- Handles manual order placement and account management

### **2. Recurring Orders Engine (backend/recurring_orders.py)**
- Reads Google Sheets for active orders
- Executes orders based on timing rules
- Logs results back to sheets
- Sends Discord notifications

### **3. Google Sheets Integration (backend/sheets_integration.py)**
- Robust authentication with service accounts
- Read/write operations with error handling
- Trade logging and portfolio tracking

### **4. API Extensions (backend/api_recurring.py)**
- REST endpoints for recurring order management
- Status monitoring and manual triggering
- Integration with main Flask app

### **5. Automation Setup (setup_cron.py)**
- Cron job setup wizard
- Multiple scheduling options
- Log management and monitoring

## ⚡ **Quick Start Guide**

### **1. Test the System**
```bash
# Test all components
uv run python tests/test_recurring_system.py

# Manual execution test
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/recurring/execute
```

### **2. Set Up Automation**
```bash
# Run the setup wizard
uv run python setup_cron.py

# Add to crontab (recommended):
0 9 * * * cd /Users/pchandak/Documents/ibind_rest_api && ./run_recurring_orders.py >> logs/recurring_orders.log 2>&1
```

### **3. Monitor Operations**
```bash
# Check system status
curl http://127.0.0.1:8082/recurring/status

# View logs
tail -f logs/recurring_orders.log

# Test Discord notifications
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/recurring/test-notification
```

### **Notification Types:**
- ✅ **Successful executions** with order details
- ❌ **Failed orders** with error messages  
- 📊 **Summary statistics** (success/failure counts)
- 💥 **System errors** and connectivity issues

---

## 🗓️ **Scheduling Logic**

### **Smart Timing System:**
- **Daily Check**: System runs every day at 9 AM EST
- **Frequency Filtering**: Only executes orders that match today's schedule
- **Grace Period**: 5-minute window for execution
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for failed connections

### **Example Schedule:**
```
Monday 9 AM:    ✅ Daily + Weekly + Monthly (if 1st)
Tuesday 9 AM:   ✅ Daily only  
Wednesday 9 AM: ✅ Daily only
...
```

## 🎯 **Use Cases & Examples**

### **Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy**
```
SPY   | $500 | Weekly   → Index fund automation
AAPL  | $200 | Weekly   → Individual stock DCA
VTI   | $1000| Monthly  → Large monthly investment
```

### **Sector Rotation**
```
QQQ   | $300 | Weekly   → Tech sector
XLF   | $200 | Weekly   → Financial sector  
XLE   | $100 | Monthly  → Energy sector
```

### **Risk Management**
- Set orders to "Inactive" to pause without deleting
- Adjust amounts in real-time
- Monitor execution history in Log column
